Sarah: Good morning everyone, let's start our weekly product development meeting. First, let's review our progress from last week.

Mike: We completed the user authentication module and it's ready for testing. The OAuth integration with Google and GitHub is working smoothly. We also fixed the bug in the dashboard that was causing slow loading times.

Lisa: I finished the wireframes for the new dashboard design. The user feedback from our beta testers was very positive. I've incorporated their suggestions for better navigation and improved the mobile responsiveness.

David: I've started testing the authentication module. So far, I've found a few minor issues that Mike is already aware of. The main functionality is solid, but we need to address some edge cases with password reset flows.

Alex: From a marketing perspective, we're ready to announce the new features. I've prepared the press release and social media content. We should coordinate the launch with the development timeline.

Sarah: Excellent progress everyone. Now let's discuss the upcoming sprint. Mike, what's the priority for this week?

Mike: We need to focus on the payment integration system. It's the last major feature before we can launch the premium version. I estimate it will take about 3-4 days to complete.

Lisa: I can work on the payment flow UI while Mike handles the backend. We should also update the pricing page to reflect the new subscription tiers.

David: I'll create test cases for the payment system. We need to test various scenarios including failed payments, refunds, and subscription cancellations.

Alex: I suggest we launch the beta version first to get user feedback before going live with the premium features. This will help us identify any issues early.

Sarah: That's a great idea, Alex. Let's plan for a beta launch next week and the full premium launch in two weeks. Mike, can you give us a status update on the payment integration by Friday?

Mike: Absolutely. I'll have a working prototype ready for testing by then.

Lisa: I'll have the UI mockups ready by Wednesday so we can review them together.

David: I'll prepare the test plan and start setting up the test environment for the payment system.

Alex: I'll coordinate with the marketing team to prepare the beta launch announcement.

Sarah: Perfect. Any other items we need to discuss today?

Mike: Just a quick note - we might need to upgrade our server infrastructure to handle the increased load from the premium features. I'll send you the cost estimates by tomorrow.

Lisa: I have a question about the user onboarding flow. Should we create separate flows for free and premium users?

Sarah: Good point, Lisa. Let's discuss that in detail during our UX review meeting on Wednesday.

David: I'm concerned about the security implications of storing payment information. We should make sure we're compliant with PCI standards.

Mike: Don't worry, we're using Stripe for payment processing, so we don't store any sensitive payment data on our servers.

Sarah: That's reassuring. Alright, let's wrap up. Great work everyone, and let's stay on track for our launch timeline. Meeting adjourned.

- Mike: Complete payment integration by Friday
